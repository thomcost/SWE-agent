**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

# SWE-agent 1.1 Introduces Performance Dashboard and Multi-model Support for AI Coding Assistants

*Princeton, NJ, April 25, 2025* - The team behind SWE-agent, the open-source framework for autonomous software engineering assistants, today announced the release of version 1.1, featuring a comprehensive performance monitoring dashboard and expanded language model support. These enhancements empower developers and researchers to better track agent activities, optimize performance, and seamlessly integrate with a wider range of AI models.

"The new monitoring dashboard provides unprecedented visibility into how AI agents approach coding tasks," said Dr. John Yang, co-creator of SWE-agent. "By tracking metrics like success rates, token usage, and execution times, teams can identify bottlenecks and optimize their agents for better results and cost efficiency."

The new features include:

- **Real-time Performance Dashboard**: A web-based interface showing key metrics including success rates, token usage, execution times, and model comparisons
- **Multi-model Adapter System**: Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, HuggingFace, and local models through a unified API
- **Beginner-friendly Configuration**: Extensively commented configuration files with clear examples and explanations
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Enhanced recovery mechanisms and detailed error diagnostics
- **GitHub PR Integration**: Automated pull request creation and management
- **Token Optimization**: Advanced token management utilities to reduce API costs

SWE-agent has already demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on software engineering benchmarks. With these new enhancements, the framework becomes more accessible to beginners while providing advanced capabilities for power users.

The SWE-agent 1.1, including the new dashboard and model adapters, is available now on GitHub under an MIT license.

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is SWE-agent?**  
A: SWE-agent is an open-source framework that lets language models use tools to autonomously solve software engineering tasks. It enables models like GPT-4 and Claude to interact with development environments to fix bugs, write code, and solve real-world programming challenges.

**Q: Who is SWE-agent designed for?**  
A: SWE-agent is designed for researchers, software developers, and organizations looking to leverage AI assistants for software development tasks. It's valuable for both individual developers wanting to enhance their workflow and research teams exploring the capabilities of AI in software engineering.

**Q: Is SWE-agent free to use?**  
A: Yes, SWE-agent is open source and available under the MIT license. However, using certain language models (like GPT-4 or Claude) will require API keys from those providers, which may have associated costs.

### Dashboard Features

**Q: What is the new dashboard in SWE-agent 1.1?**  
A: The dashboard is a real-time monitoring interface that visualizes agent activities and performance metrics. It tracks success rates, token usage, execution times, task distributions, and model comparisons to help users understand and optimize their agents' performance.

**Q: How do I start the dashboard?**  
A: You can start the dashboard by running `python -m sweagent.dashboard.run` and then opening `http://localhost:8050` in your browser. For testing purposes, you can add sample data with the `--sample-data` flag.

**Q: What metrics does the dashboard track?**  
A: The dashboard tracks several key metrics:
- Task success rates over time
- Token usage (which directly relates to API costs)
- Execution times for different operations
- Distribution of task types
- Comparative performance of different language models
- Detailed logs of recent agent activities

**Q: How does the dashboard help optimize agent performance?**  
A: The dashboard helps identify bottlenecks, high-cost operations, and unsuccessful patterns in agent behavior. By visualizing these metrics, you can adjust configurations, optimize prompts, and select the most effective models for specific task types, leading to better results and lower costs.

**Q: Can I integrate the dashboard with my existing agents?**  
A: Yes, you can easily integrate the dashboard with existing agents using the `DashboardHook` class. Simply create a hook instance and add it to your agent with `agent.add_hook(dashboard_hook)`. All agent activities will be automatically logged to the dashboard.

### Model Adapter System

**Q: What models does SWE-agent 1.1 support?**  
A: SWE-agent 1.1 supports a wide range of models through its adapter system:
- OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
- Anthropic models (Claude)
- Google models (Gemini)
- Cohere models
- HuggingFace models
- Local models (via Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)

**Q: How does the model adapter system work?**  
A: The model adapter system provides a unified API for interacting with different language models. Each adapter translates SWE-agent's requests into the format expected by the specific model provider and handles the responses accordingly. This abstraction allows users to easily switch between models without changing their code.

**Q: How do I configure a different model?**  
A: In your configuration file, specify the model name and provider-specific parameters. For example:
```yaml
model:
  name: "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
  temperature: 0.2
  top_p: 0.95
  api_key: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"  # References environment variable
```

**Q: Does switching models affect performance?**  
A: Yes, different models have different capabilities, strengths, and pricing. The dashboard's model comparison feature helps you evaluate which model performs best for your specific tasks.

**Q: Can I use my own local models?**  
A: Yes, SWE-agent 1.1 supports local models through services like Ollama or LM Studio. This allows you to run models without API costs, though performance may vary compared to cloud-based models.

### Error Handling and Token Management

**Q: How does the improved error handling work?**  
A: SWE-agent 1.1 includes a comprehensive error handling system with specialized error classes, retry logic, and recovery mechanisms. It can detect and handle context window limits, API rate limits, content policy violations, and execution timeouts, allowing agents to gracefully recover from failures.

**Q: What token management features are included?**  
A: The token management system includes:
- Token counting and budget tracking
- Per-instance and global cost limits
- Automatic handling of context window constraints
- Response caching to avoid redundant API calls
- Text chunking for efficient token usage

**Q: How does token optimization reduce costs?**  
A: Token optimization reduces costs by efficiently managing the context window, caching responses, and implementing budget constraints. The dashboard helps visualize token usage patterns to identify high-cost operations for further optimization.

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I upgrade to SWE-agent 1.1?**  
A: If you're already using SWE-agent, you can update to version 1.1 by pulling the latest changes from the repository and installing any new dependencies. Configuration files from previous versions are compatible but may not leverage all new features.

**Q: Is there documentation for new users?**  
A: Yes, we've created a comprehensive QUICKSTART.md guide and a beginner-friendly configuration file with detailed comments. The documentation has been updated to include information about the dashboard, model adapters, and all new features.

**Q: Where can I get help if I run into issues?**  
A: You can get help through the GitHub repository by opening an issue, joining the Discord community, or referring to the troubleshooting section in the documentation.
